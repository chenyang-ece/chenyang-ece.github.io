<p> Hi, I’m Chen, a noob who dreams of becoming a pro. </p>
<p>As an amateur, my ability is not very outstanding, and I lack excellent open source works. </p>
<p>So I build my blog with <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyll.com.cn/">Jekyll</a>, and plan to do a good job in the future.</p>
<p>I will log everything to help you know me better.</p>
<p>Currently I am trying to apply for a PhD. <br>
    My research interests spans <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Image Processing</b>. <br>
